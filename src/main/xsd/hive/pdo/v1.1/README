PLEASE NOTE.
These schema files are copies of PDO version 1.1 available for i2b2 v1.6.02

Reasons for copying:

(1) For code generation it was easier to make copies. 
    At least then we know we have the originating source for our generated code.
    
(2) The following changes were made to namespaces within the xsd files to facilitate code gen:

    xmlns:pdo="http://www.i2b2.org/xsd/hive/pdo/1.1/pdo" 
	targetNamespace="http://www.i2b2.org/xsd/hive/pdo/1.1/pdo"
	
	The change in each - the addition of "pdo" at the end.
